Abstract
-------

The current–voltage (I–V) curves of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been widely used as a tool to determine their electrical operation. Usually, I–V curves are described employing three cardinal points: the short-circuit point \\( I_\mathrm{sc} \\), the open-circuit point , and the maximum power point . In this context, to study the I–V curves, the single-diode model (SDM) is often used. In this manuscript, we present a practical approach for determining the parameters domain of the SDM given a set of cardinal points. An in-depth mathematical analysis showed that the SDM must satisfy the following inequalities and . Then, it is possible to implicitly represent the SDM by a single parameter and, consequently, to determine its domain. For this purpose, a fast open-source computational algorithm for the single parameter domain of the SDM is presented. The algorithm has been computer-tested using synthetically generated maximum power points which are processed in about one minute of the CPU time on a standard laptop computer. Moreover, as practical applications, the databases from the California Energy Commission and the NREL are analyzed using the presented algorithm. -->
