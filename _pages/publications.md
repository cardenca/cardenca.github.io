### <span style="color:RoyalBlue"> <u> On the Parameters Domain of the Single-Diode Model </u> </span> <br>
Authors: *Carlos Cárdenas-Bravo, Denys Dutykh, and Sylvain Lespinats* <br>
Abstract: The current–voltage (I–V) curves of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been widely used as a tool to determine their electrical operation. Usually, I–V curves are described employing three cardinal points: the short-circuit point \\( 0,\,I_\mathrm{sc}\\), the open-circuit point \\( V_\mathrm{oc},\,0 \\), and the maximum power point \\( V_\mathrm{mp},\,I_\mathrm{mp}\\). In this context, to study the I–V curves, the single-diode model (SDM) is often used. In this manuscript, we present a practical approach for determining the parameters domain of the SDM given a set of cardinal points. An in-depth mathematical analysis showed that the SDM must satisfy the following inequalities \\( \nicefrac{V_\mathrm{oc}}{2} < V_\mathrm{mp} < V_\mathrm{oc}\\) and \\( \nicefrac{I_\mathrm{sc}}{2} < I_\mathrm{mp} < I_\mathrm{sc}\\). Then, it is possible to implicitly represent the SDM by a single parameter and, consequently, to determine its domain. For this purpose, a fast open-source computational algorithm for the single parameter domain of the SDM is presented. The algorithm has been computer-tested using synthetically generated maximum power points which are processed in about one minute of the CPU time on a standard laptop computer. Moreover, as practical applications, the databases from the California Energy Commission and the NREL are analyzed using the presented algorithm.
