Born in Santiago, Chile, in 1993, I developed a passion for learning early on. 
After earning my BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering from Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM) in 2021, I embarked on a PhD journey in Applied Mathematics. 
I'm currently collaborating with Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) and the Institut National de l'Energie Solaire (INES) in France. 
My research is driven by a deep interest in energy modeling, with a special focus on unlocking the potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.

My research is currently centered on the mathematical modeling of solar photovoltaic systems, with a particular focus on the single-diode model (SDM). In [<a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/en14133925' target='_blank'>1</a>], efforts were made to identify the parameters of the SDM through a meta-heuristic algorithm. The SDM is characterized by five parameters that define the implicit relationship between current and voltage, presenting a significant challenge due to the model's inherent non-linearity. To mitigate this complexity, simplifications can be introduced by incorporating key operating points—such as short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and the maximum power point—into the model's formulation. This approach has led to the development of a one-parameter representation of the SDM, as recently detailed in [<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2024.112718' target='_blank'>2</a>]. Future research will aim to elucidate the dynamic behavior of these parameters under varying environmental conditions, such as changes in irradiance and temperature.
