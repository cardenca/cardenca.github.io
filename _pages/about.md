I was born in Santiago, Chile. He received the BSc and MSc degrees in electrical engineering from the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM), Chile, in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in applied mathematics in collaboration with the Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) and the Institut National de l'Energie Solaire (INES), France. My main interest is energy modeling, particularly in the field of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, oriented to the electrical response of solar PV systems.

  Research line
</center></h2>


Up do date, my research line is constructed around the topic of mathematical modeling applied to solar photovoltaic systems.
In this regard, [<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en14133925">1</a>] attempted to identify the parameters of the single-diode model (SDM) by using a meta-heuristic algorithm. 
The SDM counts on five parameters that implicitely relates the current and the voltage.
Therefore, this non-linearity supposes a big challenge when identifying the parameters of the SDM.
In this sense, simplifications can be made by incorporating the short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, and the maximum power point in the formulation.
This consideration leads to a one-parametric representation of the SDM, recently published [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.solener.2024.112718">2</a>].
Future works can demonstrate the evolution of the parameters according to the environmental variables such as the irradiance and the temperature.

<h2><center> 
  Scientific philosophy
</center></h2>

I believe that by helping each other we can grow faster. 
Sharing experiences, ideas, and thoughs can lead to great success.
Folling this philosophy, I am open for collaborating (find my contact in the left side of the screen).
