  About me
</center></h2>

I was born in Santiago, Chile. He received the BSc and MSc degrees in electrical engineering from Federica Santa María Technical University (UTFSM) in 2021. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in applied mathematics in collaboration with the Université Savoie Mont Blanc (USMB) and the Institut National de l'Energie Solaire (INES), France. My main interest is energy modeling, particularly in the field of solar photovoltaic energy, oriented to the electrical response of solar systems.
